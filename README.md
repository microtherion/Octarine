# Octarine - Manage Your Electronic Component Information

Octarine is an application for OS X 10.10 and later that helps to manage a collection of electronic parts:

* Search [Octopart's](https://octopart.com) library of millions of parts.
* Retain bookmarks to the parts you're interested in.
* Organize the parts as you see fit (by project, by vendor, by drawer in your basement).
* Quickly access data sheets for your parts.
